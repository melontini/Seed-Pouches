 Why is it "Pouches" if there's only 1 pouch?
 
 ## Items
 This mod adds just one item, but it's probably the best item in the game.
 
 Meet the Seed Pouch!

 ### So what can you do with the damn thing?
 
 Good Question! When you use the pouch it releases a projectile which, upon landing, drops a plethora of different crops.

 But upon colliding with a player, the bag will immediately insert all of it's loot into that player's inventory, without dropping anything on the ground.
 
 You can also just use the bag on a player to achieve the same effect without releasing the projectile.
